This directory holds the entire autonomous build of **H. R. 9510 Bill v5.0**, the
*Verification Before Generation in Physical AI Oncology Trials Act of 2026*,
**the Financial Data Amendment**. The build is driven by the single
[`master-prompt.md`](master-prompt.md): Process A generated every sub-prompt
under [`sub-prompts/`](sub-prompts), and Process B runs those sub-prompts in
order, producing the four research stages (`01`-`04`) and the three bill stages
(`draft-bill`, `full-bill`, `final-bill`). Every distinguishable file is a
separate commit pushed in real time; the nine stage milestones are tracked in
one continuously updated pull request (Rules 7, 8, 9).

## The two main updates over Bill v4.0

1. **A comprehensive financial-data focus.** Bill v5.0 is built from the Bill
   v3.0 LaTeX measure (`cancer-automated/papers/VVUQ-05/final-bill`, without its
   `/deliverables`) and adds an operative financial core: a financial-data
   record inside new section 515D, a new SEC. 5 (financial data transparency,
   device user-fee treatment, an authorization of appropriations, and the
   Statutory PAYGO budgetary-effects clause), and four non-operative financial
   appendices (cost estimate and budgetary data; verification economics; the
   financial-data transparency standard; the financial research-influence
   matrix).
2. **Three visual media, each where it is correct.** Bill v4.0 was Mermaid-only;
   Bill v5.0 deliberately carries **tables, ASCII figures, and gray-scale
   Mermaid diagrams** together: full-width tables for enumerable financial
   data, monospace ASCII for ledgers, money flows, and fixed-width timelines,
   and gray-scale Mermaid (real `mermaid` blocks in Markdown, gray-scale TikZ
   in the compiled LaTeX) for processes and systems. No raster images anywhere.

## The auto-commit / PR schedule (updated for this run)

The prior build opened one pull request per stage and merged each to `main`.
This run executes in a managed environment that permits exactly one development
branch, `claude/funny-meitner-7ywlgc`, so the schedule is updated (Master prompt,
Rule 8): each prior PR becomes one **stage milestone** - a contiguous, labeled
set of commits, one commit per file, each pushed the moment it is generated -
and all nine milestones are tracked in **one continuously updated pull request**
whose description is refreshed as each milestone lands.
